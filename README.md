#Nudity Detection using Hybrid ResNet-50 + Swin Transformer

This project implements a nudity detection model using a hybrid approach that combines a Convolutional Neural Network (ResNet-50) with a Transformer-based model (Swin Transformer). The model is fine-tuned to classify images into three categories: regular, semi-nudity, and full-nudity.
